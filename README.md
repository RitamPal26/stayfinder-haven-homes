# StayFinder 🏡

An open-source, full-stack accommodation marketplace inspired by Airbnb – **scaffolded end-to-end with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) during the “Free Weekend: AI Showdown” hackathon**. The project demonstrates how far you can push prompt-driven development: every page, component and API was generated by the AI and refined in chat, with **zero manual coding**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-handle/stayfinder.git
cd stayfinder

# 2. Install deps
pnpm i   # or npm install

# 3. Environment
cp .env.example .env        # fill Supabase & Stripe keys
pnpm supabase db reset      # optional: seed data

# 4. Run
pnpm dev                    # http://localhost:5173
```

> The layout mirrors the Hackathon-Starter structure (config, controllers, models, views) for familiarity in rapid builds[4].

## 📂 Folder Structure
```
stayfinder/
├─ ai-prompts/          # all Lovable prompt history
├─ src/
│  ├─ components/
│  ├─ pages/
│  └─ hooks/
├─ server/              # generated Express API
├─ supabase/            # SQL schema & seed
└─ docs/screenshots/    # images for README
```

Including an *ai-prompts* directory preserves provenance and helps others reproduce the build, a recommendation for transparent README files[5].
