# StayFinder 🏡

An open-source, full-stack accommodation marketplace inspired by Airbnb – **scaffolded end-to-end with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) during the “Free Weekend: AI Showdown” hackathon**. The project demonstrates how far you can push prompt-driven development: every page, component and API was generated by the AI and refined in chat, with **zero manual coding**.
